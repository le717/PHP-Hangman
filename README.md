# Hangman #

> Hangman game written using PHP, SCSS, and JavaScript

This was my final project in PHP class, earning a grade of 100%. All code is portable, developed under PHP 5.4, tested on PHP 5.6 and 7.0, and requires no third-party modules. SCSS build script makes use of the [libsass-python](http://hongminhee.org/libsass-python/) project.
